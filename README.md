## Why do I want to get into daily Github Usage?

** That is a great question, thanks for asking! **

1. The world will only become more digital
2. Software is less capex intensive but can have equal if not greater impacts than hardware
3. There is an opportunity to fix what I see as a global problem by making technology accessible to all
